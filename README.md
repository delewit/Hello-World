# Hello-World
Just practicing to figure out how to use Github for future projects.
I am a computer science major at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, Illinois.  It's a great school!
And I am a great CS student!  (Or at least I try to be.)
PYTHON could be my favorite programming language!!!
